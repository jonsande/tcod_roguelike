A traditional roguelike currently in development.

Main features:
- A rich world with its own story and lore.
- Choose between pure ASCII or pseudo-ASCII graphics.
- Procedural map generation with multiple layers.
- Handcrafted maps and carefully designed scenarios.
- A fresh, tactical combat system built for depth and strategy.
- Stealth mechanics for those who prefer subtlety over strength.
- Unique and special in-game events.
- Diverse and challenging enemy AI.
- Atmospheric sound effects and select visual enhancements.
- Raycasting-based field of view.
- Field of hearing, for more complex and interesting stealth mechanics.
- Potions, scrolls, magical items, unique artifacts...
- And much more to come.

Developed in Python using the tcod and pygame libraries. Inspired by the excellent “Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial” (https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/).
